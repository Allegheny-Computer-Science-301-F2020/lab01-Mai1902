### Article 1
 1. Article name.
  -  How Our Data Got Hacked, Scandalized, and Abused in 2018

 2. Reference or article citation.
 - Fast Company. (2019, January 02). How Our Data Got Hacked, Scandalized, and Abused in 2018. Retrieved September 11, 2020, from https://medium.com/fast-company/how-our-data-got-hacked-scandalized-and-abused-in-2018-cffcda174531

 3. Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article summarizes and points out some notorious data scandal in the year of 2018. For years, customers have raised doubts about the confidentiality of their own private information online. Then, the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke down, resulting in multiple investigations on different websites; hence, the real usage of customer private information was finally being exposed: giant tech companies are abusing our data. At the end of the article, the author asserted some solutions for this situation, but these solutions would be useless if governments choose to stand still.

 4. What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern here is who gave these companies the right to steal, use, and abuse one information without noticing the owner. Such an act is just another form of crime, as it goes against community standards and may as well harm other people. These stolen data can be used to help companies advertise their goods, and it is also powerful enough to affect political decisions.

 5. What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The majority forms of data have been included in this article. However, the two events that I concern about the most are Facebook private information scandal, and the Fitness app Polar scandal. In the case of Facebook, most of the stolen data were private information such as birth of date, interest, relationships, etc. The problem here is the amount of data that Facebook stole and abused was enormous. Such a big poll of data can help companies, politicians, etc, to predict customers trends, then manipulate the thought flows by using their customers interest. In the Fitness app Polar scandal, the main users of this app are the army; this app basically records these soldiers' heart rate, strength, and even their station. The vulnerability of these data can put these soldiers into lethal risks if their enemies hack into the system.

 6. Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - In the Facebook scandal, Cambridge Analytica is a consulting firm, harvesting user data by establishing a quiz then publishing it on Facebook. Everyone who takes this quiz and the people that the quiz takers share the links to gave this firm a chance to steal their info.
 - In the Fitness app Polar, the main cause of data abuse here is from the vulnerability of this app protection. Thus, this app unofficially allows anyone with curiosity to look at their clients’ confidential data.

 7. Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Obviously, companies and politicians gain a lot in this form of analysis. They can use this big data to predict customers, or civilians preference. And using these predictions for a lot of mischievous acts.
 - All clients, on the other hand, do not only lose their data but also can be manipulated by the thieves without acknowledging it.


### Article 2
 1. Article name.
  - The scary side of big data

 2. Reference or article citation.
 - Kochetkova, K., Ilyin, Y., Grustniy, L., Aver, H., Kuksov, I., & Ferapontov, A. (n.d.). The creepy and scary side of big data abuse. Retrieved September 11, 2020, from https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/scary-big-data/9626/

 3. Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - This article digs deeper into the danger of data abuse, in which it is not only used for advertising purposes, but can also be used to control and predict people's behaviors from solid data. The most dangerous type of companies that abuse customer data are insurance companies, banks and also the human resources department in companies.

 4. What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern here is first, the insurance company and bank can track what do you spend money on in a day, when do you have meal, where are you at the moment by tracing your credit card footprints. Such a close tracking can be considered as stalking, but since these are banks and insurance companies, they can do that “legally”. Moreover, the way recruiters and human resources officers use big data

 5. What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - As I already mentioned in the above sections, credit cards footprints and backgrounds are two types of data that are being manipulated in this article

 6. Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - For insurance companies in banks, they have credit card information of users and as their distinct function, these cards always recorded the transaction locations. However, these transaction details are being recorded by the companies as well.
 - For recruiters, they simply put background information of candidates, and also their own officers into a large pool and compare these people from section to section.

 7. Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Again, companies are the winners again. By tracking users credit card footprints, insurance companies and banks can predict the default risk of this person. For human resources departments, they can save a lot of time, money, and effort if they use data and algorithms to choose a successful candidate.
 - The losers are everyone else. Even though the act of credit cards tracking is reasonable, it can still make users vulnerable towards identity theft. And for recruiters' problems, some people do not have enough resources to gain a handful of experience but the machine will disqualify them based on the requirement of recruiters.
